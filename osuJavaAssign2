//Modify the HelloJack program so that it prompts the user for
// his/her name, inputs the name, and outputs the message Hello, <name> 
// where <name> is the name entered by the user.
//Once you are done, make sure there are no errors, run the program a 
// few times with different inputs to see whether it does what it should and, 
// if not, fix the problems until you get it to work as expected.
